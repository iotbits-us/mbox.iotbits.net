When sending data to the cloud platform, the MQTT topic and payload to be sent, must match the receiving platforms requirements of topic as well as the payload structure. Since one of the major features of the ModbusBox is its flexibility, we made possible to select different profiles for the topic and data structure and we called it **Cloud Data Modes**.

There are currently three **Cloud Data Modes** available:

* Standard Mode
* Ubidots Compatibility Mode
* Extended Ubidots Compatibility Mode

If you plan to use your own MQTT broker and visualization tool, use the **Standard Mode** and you should be able to adapt the receiving endpoint to the **Standard Mode**. 

> We plan to add the possibility of create custom **Cloud Data Modes** in future developments. 



## Standard Mode

Here goes a detailed description of the Standard Mode.

 

## Ubidots Compatibility Mode

## Extended Ubidots Compatibility Mode
