## Microcontroller

Out ModbusBox features a powerful [ESP32-WROOM-32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview). This microcontroller is capable of functioning reliably in industrial environments, with an operating temperature ranging from â€“40Â°C to +125Â°C. Powered by advanced calibration circuitries, ESP32 can dynamically remove external circuit imperfections and adapt to changes in external conditions.

Engineered for mobile devices, wearable electronics and IoT applications, ESP32 achieves ultra-low power consumption with a combination of several types of proprietary software. ESP32 also includes state-of-the-art features, such as fine-grained clock gating, various power modes and dynamic power scaling.

## Control Buttons

As you can see in the following image, there are three control buttons located on the PCB. These control buttons allows the user to switch between operation modes and to perform other advanced procedures.

![modbusbox-control-buttons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotbits-us/mbox.iotbits.net/master/static/img/modbusbox-control-buttons.png)

Figure 2



### PROG Button

Use this button to put the device in **Programming Mode** in order to upload a new firmware. To enter into **Programming Mode**, press and hold  **Programming** button and quick press and release **Reset** button. 

For more information regarding this operational mode, refer to the [Programming Mode]() documentation or the following guide: [Uploading firmware in Programming Mode](uploading-firmware-programming-mode).

### SETUP Button

This is a multifunction button that can triggered many actions depending on the state of the device.

For more information regarding this operational mode, refer to the [Setup Mode]() documentation or the following guide: [Putting Device in Setup Mode]().

### RST Button

Used this button to perform a factory reset of the device and restore its defaults state.

For more information regarding this operational mode, refer to the [Factory Reset]() documentation or the following guide: [Restoring the device's factory state]().



## LED Indicators

ModbusBox has 4 LEDs indicators and 1 multicolor LED for system status. This light indicators are very useful to quickly understand the operational status of the ModbusBox. They also helps to troubleshoot any problem with the device operation. 



### LEDs

The following table aims to describe every LED of the 4 found on the ModbusBox.

## Connectors

ModbusBox has only one connector exposed, that is the **RJ45** connector used to connect the ModbusBox to the modbus slaves. The 24v needed for ModbusBox and provided by the slaves also comes through this same connector.

There are other connectors located in the ModbusBox PCB that may be used by developers when using the ModbusBox for with their own custom firmware.

> Details about this additional connectors will be added to this documentation in the future.
